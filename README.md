# Mission-to-Mars

## Background
Robin is now ready to take on the full web-scraping and data analysis project for the mission to Mars. She’s learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. She’s also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

I’ll help Robin scrape, organize, analyze, and visualize the data. As I work on this Challenge, remember that I am trengthening the same core skills that I have been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating my insights.

## Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

Open the Jupyter Notebook in the starter code folder named part_1_mars_news.ipynb. You will work in this code as you follow the steps below to scrape the Mars News website.

Use automated browsing to visit the Mars NASA news site Links to an external site.. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
